# LU-Decomposition-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the LU Decomposition method for solving systems of linear equations. The code reads coefficients from an Excel file (`read.xls`), performs LU Decomposition to factorize the matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices, and then solves the system of equations.
